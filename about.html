								<p>In 2017, the <a href="https://www.wisegroup.co.nz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wise Group</a> was concerned about the state of mental wellbeing support in New Zealand:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>There was a massive amount of unmet need.</li><li>There were many barriers that stopped people from reaching out for help.</li><li>People were having to wait, in some cases, up to six months for professional help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Ignoring this was not an option. So, the Wise Group made a commitment to ensure every New Zealander can receive the mental wellbeing support they need, in a way that works for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>We searched the world for an empirically supported, effective online therapy tool.</h3><p>We found a world-leading tool developed by a team of clinicians and researchers from St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney and the University of New South Wales to improve personal wellbeing and for the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders.&nbsp;</p><p>The Wise Group purchased the tool and spent over a year enhancing and adapting it for the New Zealand environment and people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Jump to 2019 and Just a Thought was born.</h3><p>Just a Thought offers evidence-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) online and is designed for people with mild-to-moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. CBT teaches people how to control their emotions, thoughts and behaviour to improve their mental health.&nbsp;</p>

I didn’t find it too difficult and it felt very achievable. The course was also helpful because it turned out all the things I was doing to try and figure out what was happening and to help myself were actually doing the opposite. </p><p>So even when some activities got difficult, I could at least stop the bad things straight away even if I couldn’t quite get my head around the good actions yet. I also liked that I got to do things on my own. I found this empowering.

										<div class="testimonial-copy-wrapper">
												<p>“I've always struggled with low mood/slight anxiety throughout my life. However last year I went through an instance of extreme adult bullying that greatly impacted me. I ended up developing low self-esteem leading to depression.</p><p>Later on, I realised I also had developed severe anxiety too and it became completely debilitating. I found out about the Just a Thought website and so I began the depression course first…The main thing it helped me with was strategies to challenge my thoughts and ways to improve my self-worth. I began the anxiety course a few months after that. <strong>It made such a huge difference to my life</strong>. I am now able to stop myself and do a little thought challenging activity on my phone. I mix it with a breathing strategy and it helps significantly.</p><p>Since the start of the course I have now started art classes, kickboxing classes, regular yoga classes, I got a new job, and I am looking for a new home right now. Before this I was too anxious to do any of these things. I know it will be an ongoing recovery with lapses, but<strong> I love that I now have the strategies I need to calm myself and talk myself out of my anxiety.</strong>”</p>
